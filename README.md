# Random-USACO-Stuff

This is a repo of all the USACO problems I did. Note that not all of the solutions here are coded by me; a lot are taken from the USACO guide website (https://usaco.guide/). The way you can distinguish if a solution is mine (not very likely), then just look at whether there are any comments on the code or not â€” I never comment on my own code. I do not take credit for any solution that do not belong to me.
